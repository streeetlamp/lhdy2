# Bread Pudding

## How To: 
```bash
npm install
```

```bash
bower install
```

Run a few tasks to initialize everything
```bash
grunt init
```

Time to start the dev server
```bash
grunt dev
```

Work in the `app` directory. 

When ready for production use the build task.

```bash
grunt build
```

It will create a new `build` directory that is ready for deployment.


```bash
                 ____
     .----------'    '-.
    /  .      '     .   \\ *
